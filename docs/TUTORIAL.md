# Tutorial: Getting Started with Simulation Hypothesis Explorer

## Overview

The Simulation Hypothesis Explorer is an interactive tool that explores the possibility that our reality might be a computational simulation. Using machine learning and theoretical physics models, you can adjust parameters and visualize how higher dimensions might affect the probability that we're in a simulation.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simulation-hypothesis-explorer.git
   cd simulation-hypothesis-explorer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

## Basic Usage

### Main Interface

The main page allows you to adjust several parameters:

- **Dimensions**: Select the number of spatial dimensions to simulate (3D to 11D+)
- **Simulation Factor**: Adjust how "simulated" the reality appears (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Projection Type**: Choose how higher dimensions are projected to 3D

Click "Run Simulation" to see how these parameters affect the visualization and calculated simulation probability.

### Understanding the Outputs

- **3D Visualization**: Shows the projected higher-dimensional structure
- **Simulation Probability**: Percentage likelihood that the model represents a simulation
- **Detected Artifacts**: Patterns that might indicate computational constraints
- **Probability Trend**: Chart showing how probability changes over time

## Advanced Features

### Parameter Space Explorer

Visit `/parameter-explorer.html` to experiment with multiple parameters simultaneously:

- Adjust multiple parameters at once
- See how they interact and affect simulation probability
- Use "Auto-Explore" to automatically vary parameters
- View probability trends and parameter impacts

### Dimensional Analysis

Visit `/dimensional-analysis.html` to analyze how dimension count affects simulation probability:

- Set a range of dimensions to analyze
- Run multiple iterations per dimension
- Compare physics theories (String, M-theory, Kaluza-Klein)
- Export results for further analysis

### Dimensions Visualization

Visit `/dimensions-visualization.html` to understand different dimensional spaces:

- Visualize 1D through 11D+ spaces
- See how physics might work in different dimensions
- Learn about the implications for the simulation hypothesis
- Animate and rotate dimensional structures

## Interpretation Guide

### Simulation Probability

- **0-30%**: Low probability of simulation
- **31-60%**: Moderate indicators of simulation
- **61-80%**: Significant simulation signatures
- **81-100%**: Strong evidence of simulation

### Types of Artifacts

1. **Grid Patterns**: Suggest discretization at fundamental scales
2. **Perfect Symmetries**: Indicate computational optimization
3. **Mathematical Constants**: Show elegant physics that might indicate design
4. **Quantization Effects**: Reveal digital artifacts in physical properties

## Scientific Background

### The Simulation Hypothesis

The simulation hypothesis suggests that reality could be an artificial simulation. This project explores this idea computationally by:

- Modeling higher-dimensional physics
- Detecting patterns that might indicate computational constraints
- Calculating the probability that our reality shows signs of simulation

### Higher Dimensions

Modern physics theories like string theory require additional spatial dimensions. These might be:

- Compactified (curled up) like in Kaluza-Klein theory
- Part of a larger mathematical structure as in string theory
- Hidden computational parameters in a simulated reality

## Customization

### Adding New Physics Models

You can extend the simulation by modifying `models/SimulationModel.js`:

```javascript
// Add new physics transformations
simulateNewForce(data) {
  // Your custom force simulation here
}
```

### Creating New Visualizations

Add new visualization methods to the frontend JavaScript files:

```javascript
// In app.js or related files
createNewVisualization() {
  // Your visualization code
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Visualization not loading**: Ensure WebGL is enabled in your browser
2. **Slow performance**: High-dimensional simulations are computationally intensive
3. **API errors**: Check that the server is running on port 3000

### Performance Tips

- Use fewer dimensions for faster processing
- Reduce sample size in simulation parameters
- Close other intensive applications

## Research Applications
